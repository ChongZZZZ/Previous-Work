- Make a readme file
- Make the powerpoint


CHECK:
- Add a check for if player 2 enters the wrong board size in the multiplayer version
- Do documentaiton


- Implement: you will first choose whether to play with x's or o's



 On multiplayer, the o got 3 in a row first. The winner checking function doesn't check for it.


- If we have time, add support for a board where spaces have 2-digit numbers,
  like in a 20x20 board for example. 
        - MAX_MESSAGE (larger)
        - input read in to read 2 digit and 2 digit
